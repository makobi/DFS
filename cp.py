# Description:
#
#       The main purpose of this script is to handle the copy command
#		issued by the user. When the user runs this script, the script 
#		connects to the meta-data server using the command-line arguments
#		provided by the user. After the connection is established the 
#		the meta-data server responds with the data the script requested,
#		i.e. all the available nodes. After the data is received, the
#		the scripts parse the data to separate the information of each node,
#		connects to each of them and sends them the chunks of the file. 
#		After the chunks are stored the client sends the nodes it used to
#		store the chunks to the meta-data server.
#
# How to Run:
#		
#		Pre-requisites - To run this script, the meta-data and the data node 
#						 servers must be up and running. (See: meta-data.py and data-node.py)
#
#		- Open terminal
#		- Move to the containing folder
#		- Run 'python cp.py < Command > < Path to file in computer > < meta-data server ip > < meta-data server port >:< Path to file in DFS >
#		- i.e. python cp.py -t /Users/Makobi/Documents/hola.txt localhost 30001:Desktop/Test.txt
#		- i.e. python cp.py -f /Users/Makobi/hola.txt localhost 30001:Desktop/Test.txt
