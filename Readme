Second Submit:

	Installation:

		- I installed the database in OS Mavericks

	Libraries: 

		- socket: Enable comunication between the meta data server, the clients and the data nodes
		- threading: Enable Multi-threading 
		- sys: Enable in-line parameters
		- MySQLdb: Enable database connection

	meta-data.py: 

		- Right now the meta-data.py connects to the database and proves it by inserting 
		  two data-nodes into the database. Then checks what data-nodes are available and
		  prints their information. After that it inserts the information of two files into
		  the database.

		- After the pre-setting is done it waits for a client to send
		  a command. When it receives the command the meta-data sends the connection to a new
		  thread (Multi-Threading). THe thread checks the header and prints
		  the corresponding command.

	client.py:

		- Connects to the meta-data server and sends three commands to test the headers and
		  the connections.

	How to run:

		- Open terminal
		- Move to the containing folder
		- Open two tabs or more if you want to test multi-threading
		- In one tab run 'python meta-data.py <port>' i.e. python meta-data.py 50003
		- On the other tabs run 'python client.py <id> localhost <port>' 
		  i.e. python client.py 1 localhost 50003 

Third Submit:

	meta-data.py: 

		Achieved:

			Right now the meta-data server responds to all the commands requested by the client except 

		Bugs (working on it): 

			- When information that is allready in the DB changes, it does not get updated

		In progress:

			- Handle the copy command.

			- Run a book_keeping functionality to check the state of the nodes every t time.

			- Documentation

	data-node.py:

		Achieved:

			- The data nodes when started send a command to the meta-data so their id is set. After that they create a directory with their respective names. Right now the data nodes can store and send back to the client chunks. 

		Bugs (Currently fixing): 

			- The files that store the chunks are saved outside of their directory.

		In progress:

			- Documentation

	client.py:

		Acheived:

			- Client right now handles all the commands except copy. It connects succesfully to the meta-data server and to the data-nodes too. 

		In progress:

			- Handle copy command

			- Enable manual input to users

			- Documentation

	General:

		- The commands are not being parsed yet, right now the commands and some parameters are hard
		coded. For this demo is better to run the program with cheo.txt, not because it won't work with other files but because you would have to change it in every place. Instead of changing the File maybe changing the content of cheo.txt is a better option for now.

	How to run:

		- Open terminal
		- Move to the containing folder
		- Open two tabs or more if you want to test multi-threading
		- In one tab run 'python meta-data.py <port>' i.e. python meta-data.py 50003
		- On the other tabs run 'python data-node.py localhost <port>' 
		  i.e. python data-node.py 1 localhost 50003 
		- On the other tabs run 'python client.py <id> localhost <port>' 
		  i.e. python client.py 1 localhost 50003
