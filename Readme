	Installation:

		- I installed the database in OS Mavericks

	Libraries: 

		- socket: Enable comunication between the meta data server, the clients and the data nodes
		- threading: Enable Multi-threading 
		- sys: Enable in-line parameters
		- MySQLdb: Enable database connection

	meta-data.py: 

		- Right now the meta-data.py connects to the database and proves it by inserting 
		  two data-nodes into the database. Then checks what data-nodes are available and
		  prints their information. After that it inserts the information of two files into
		  the database.

		- After the pre-setting is done it waits for a client to send
		  a command. When it receives the command the meta-data sends the connection to a new
		  thread (Multi-Threading). THe thread checks the header and prints
		  the corresponding command.

	client.py:

		- Connects to the meta-data server and sends three commands to test the headers and
		  the connections.

	How to run:

		- Open terminal
		- Move to the containing folder
		- Open two tabs or more if you want to test multi-threading
		- In one tab run 'python meta-data.py <port>' i.e. python meta-data.py 50003
		- On the other tabs run 'python client.py <id> localhost <port>' 
		  i.e. python client.py 1 localhost 50003
