	Installation:

		- I installed the database in OS Mavericks

	Libraries: 

		- socket: Enable comunication between the meta data server, the clients and the data nodes
		- threading: Enable Multi-threading 
		- sys: Enable inline parameters
		- MySQLdb: Enable database connection

	meta-data.py: 

		- Right now the meta-data.py connects to the database and proves it by inserting 
		  two data-nodes into the database. Then checks what data-nodes are available and
		  prints their information. After that it inserts the information of two files into
		  the database.

		- After the pre-setting is done it creates a thread that waits for a client to send
		  a command. When it receives the command the meta-data checks the header and prints
		  the corresponding command.

	client.py:

		- Connects to the meta-data server and sends three commands to test the headers and
		  the connections.
