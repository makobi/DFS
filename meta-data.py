# Description:
#
#       The main purpose of this script is to provide meta data to the clients
#		When this script starts it listens for connections. If the connection
#		was stablished by a data-node it stores the meta-data of the datanode 
#		into the database. If the connections was stablihed by a client it checks
# 		the command that was issued and decides what to do. If the command was a
# 		list it return all the files that are stored in the DFS. Is the command 
#		was a write, it returns the available nodes and then stores the nodes the
#		client used to store the chunks. If the command was a read command it 
#		checks in the database what data nodes the client used to store that 
#		particular file and returns them to the client. Else the command is not
# 		recognized.
#
# Run:
#
#		- Open terminal
#		- Move to the containing folder
#		- run 'python list.py < meta-data server ip > < meta-data server port >
#		- i.e. python meta-data.py localhost 50003
